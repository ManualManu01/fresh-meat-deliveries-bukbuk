```

### 2. Configure SMTP (Optional)

## Environment-Specific Notes

### For Netlify:
Create `_redirects` file:
```
/*    /enhanced-bukbuk.html   200
```

### For Vercel:
Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/enhanced-bukbuk.html" }
  ]
}
```

### For GitHub Pages:
- Rename `enhanced-bukbuk.html` to `index.html`
- Ensure all paths are relative
- May need to enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
